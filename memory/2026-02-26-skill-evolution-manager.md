## Conversation Summary

user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Execute your Session Startup sequence now - read the required files before responding to the user. Then greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.
assistant: Hey there. I'm your OpenClaw assistant—concise, opinionated, and here to get things done without the fluff. What would you like to tackle today?
user: Pre-compaction memory flush. Store durable memories now (use memory/2026-02-26.md; create memory/ if needed). IMPORTANT: If the file already exists, APPEND new content only and do not overwrite existing entries. If nothing to store, reply with NO_REPLY.
Current time: Thursday, February 26th, 2026 — 23:28 (Asia/Shanghai)
user: System: [2026-02-26 23:27:00 GMT+8] ⚠️ Post-Compaction Audit: The following required startup files were not read after context reset:
  - WORKFLOW_AUTO.md
  - memory\/\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\.md

Please read them now using the Read tool before continuing. This ensures your operating protocols are restored after memory compaction.
