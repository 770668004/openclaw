- Encountered SSH permission issues when trying to push to new repository
- Current SSH key (ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIOwMuwyd39jPY8ST7W8rgT5//oYkU2OGxW6lCt1XRbkt) is associated with old uskousoyu account
- Need to either add SSH key to new 770668004 account or switch to HTTPS authentication

## SSH Key Resolution Discussion
- Discussed three solutions for GitHub SSH key conflict:
  1. Add existing SSH key to new 770668004 account
  2. Generate new SSH key pair for new account
  3. Temporarily use HTTPS authentication
- Awaiting user preference on which approach to implement

## SSH Key Query Assistance
- Provided user with commands to check existing SSH keys
- Confirmed current key details from memory
- Offered to generate new SSH key for new GitHub account

## SSH Key Verification
- Verified current Ed25519 public key: ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIOo8suND9C1rJxRJ7HVQOx2Py5PJJwAOAGt2RhtezIab 770668004@qq.com
