## Conversation Summary

user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Execute your Session Startup sequence now - read the required files before responding to the user. Then greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.
assistant: Hey. I'm online and ready — no fluff, just help. What would you like to do?  

*(P.S. Your default model is `qwen3-plus`, but we're currently using `qwen3-max`.)*
user: Pre-compaction memory flush. Store durable memories now (use memory/2026-02-26.md; create memory/ if needed). IMPORTANT: If the file already exists, APPEND new content only and do not overwrite existing entries. If nothing to store, reply with NO_REPLY.
Current time: Thursday, February 26th, 2026 — 22:11 (Asia/Shanghai)
assistant: NO_REPLY
user: System: [2026-02-26 22:02:09 GMT+8] ⚠️ Post-Compaction Audit: The following required startup files were not read after context reset:
  - WORKFLOW_AUTO.md
  - memory\/\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}\.md

Please read them now using the Read tool before continuing. This ensures your operating protocols are restored after memory compaction.

[Thu 2026-02-26 22:11 GMT+8] 处理，重复文件可以自我整合后进化再删除多余，其他的你自我优化修复
assistant: 已读取必要的启动文件，现在系统已完全恢复操作协议。我将根据WORKFLOW_AUTO.md中的配置执行自动化工作流，并确保遵循安全规则和通信协议。

对于重复文件的整合和优化，我会：
1. 识别重复或冗余的文件
2. 合并有价值的内容
3. 删除多余的副本
4. 保持文件结构的整洁

请问您希望我从哪些特定文件或目录开始这个优化过程？或者有其他优先级更高的任务需要处理吗？
